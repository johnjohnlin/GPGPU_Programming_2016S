# General submission guidelines

## Repo URL change is forbidden (40% penalty)
"git push --force" is useful since TA only clones your code right after the deadline.

## Always run cuda-memcheck (50% penalty)
`cuda-memcheck` is handy and useful, and you should always check your program with it.

## Be sure to put the file at correct path (40% penalty)
If we ask you to submit /lab1/hello.cu, do not submit /Lab1/hello.cu, /hello.cu, or /homework/lab1/hello.cu.

## Others
* Git conflict (20% penalty)
* Add large binary files (20% penalty)
* Miss the deadline (10% penalty/day)
